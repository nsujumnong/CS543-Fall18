Assignment 3

For this assignment, open GLSLExperiment.sln and compile the code as usual. Sometimes it may gives error, so just clear and rebuild the solution. 

Once the code is compiled, the windows with 6 meshes floating and rotating should show up. The highest level mesh should rotate in counter-clockwise direction. The 2nd level 
meshes should rotate in clockwise direction and moved regarding to the upper level mesh. The 3rd level meshes should rotate in counter-clockwise direction and moved accordingly 
to the 2nd and 1st level meshes. The 

Keyboard input:
press 's' to make the meshes in 2nd and 3rd level move up and down in sinusoidal wave.
Note: The implementation of idle function for the sinusoidal wave doesn't work, so you will have to press and hold the 's' button to make a continuous sinusoidal motion.


For the rest of the program:
- The spotlight hasn't been implemented in the code, so there will be no light source or keyboard input for the spotlight.
- There's a problem with the solid color of each mesh, therefore the shading doesn't work properly for this program.
- The box for each mesh is not implemented.
