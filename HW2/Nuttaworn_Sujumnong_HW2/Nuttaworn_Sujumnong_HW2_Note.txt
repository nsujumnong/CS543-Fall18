Project 2

Instruction: Run the the GLSLExperiment.sln as usual. When the application is opened, the first displayed mesh should be an ant.ply.

Keyboard interaction:

Press 'X': The mesh should slide in x+ direction and stop sliding when the key is pressed again
press 'x': The mesh should slide in x- direction and stop sliding when the key is pressed again
Press 'Y': The mesh should slide in Y+ direction and stop sliding when the key is pressed again
press 'y': The mesh should slide in y- direction and stop sliding when the key is pressed again
Press 'Z': The mesh should slide in Z+ direction and stop sliding when the key is pressed again
press 'z': The mesh should slide in z- direction and stop sliding when the key is pressed again
Press 'H': The mesh should shear along y- direction. Keep pressing it and the shear will keep decreasing
Press 'h': The mesh should shear along y+ direction. Keep pressing it and the shear will keep increasing
Press 'W': The mesh should return to it's original position and orientation
Press 'B': The mesh should start pulsing
Press 'N': The next mesh from the ply files list should be drawn.
Press 'P': The previous mesh from the ply files list should be drawn

NOTE: 
- Due to poor memory allocation method for pulse function, the program may crash if the mesh is pulsed for too long.
- When the mesh pulsing started, pressing W will not return it to original state
- Due to some unknown reason, if the mesh is transformed beyond curtain point, pressing W may not return it to original position
and orientation
